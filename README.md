## 🎯 Game Rules

The game follows these winning rules:

- ✊ Rock crushes Scissors
- ✊ Rock crushes Lizard
- ✋ Paper covers Rock
- ✋ Paper disproves Spock
- ✌️ Scissors cut Paper
- ✌️ Scissors decapitate Lizard
- 🦎 Lizard poisons Spock
- 🦎 Lizard eats Paper
- 🖖 Spock smashes Scissors
- 🖖 Spock vaporizes Rock

As Sam Kass, the creator of this variation, explains: *"I invented this game (with Karen Bryla) because it seems like when you know someone well enough, 75-80% of any Rock Paper Scissors games you play with that person end up in a tie. Well, here is a slight variation that reduces that probability."*

## 🚀 Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Download the `rock_paper_scissors_lizard_spock.py` file.
3. No additional libraries are required as this game uses only the standard `random` module.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Run the script in your terminal/command prompt:
   ```
   python rock_paper_scissors_lizard_spock.py
   ```

2. When prompted, enter a number to make your choice:
   - 1 for Rock (✊)
   - 2 for Paper (✋)
   - 3 for Scissors (✌️)
   - 4 for Lizard (🦎)
   - 5 for Spock (🖖)
   - 6 to Quit

3. The computer will randomly choose its option.

4. The winner is determined based on the game rules.

5. After each round, you'll be asked if you want to play again.
